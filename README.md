# Smart2048

Author: Yunkai Wang  

The project tries to evolve neural network using genetic algorithm to play the 2048 game. Most of the codes are taken from [SmartSnake](https://github.com/yunkaiwang/SmartSnake "Smart snake") repo, and from [2048](https://github.com/yunkaiwang/2048 "2048") repo. However, the results are not as good as the result of applying the same technique to the snake game. The AIs just try to move pieces randomly without keeping the largest number at a corner (which is the best technique to win the game), the largest number that the AI get is 256, which is still far away from 2048.
